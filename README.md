# Thymeline

A window organizer for Windows that arranges application windows in a scrollable 2D grid with smooth animations.

## What is Thymeline?

Thymeline is a Windows application that manages other application windows, arranging them in a 2D plane where you can scroll horizontally through columns and vertically through rows. Each window becomes a tile in this grid.

**Note:** This is not a true window manager - it's an application that repositions and manages other windows. Your regular Windows desktop environment remains unchanged.. it was designed this way to help users stay organized on windows machines where they don't have admin privileges.

## Features

- **2D Grid Layout** - Windows arranged in rows and columns
- **Smooth Scrolling** - Navigate horizontally and vertically through your window grid
- **Smart Positioning** - Windows automatically arrange themselves without gaps
- **Adjustable Transparency** - Set window transparency (50-255 alpha)
- **Dynamic Margins** - Adjust spacing between windows
- **Variable Frame Rates** - 60/90/120/144 FPS animation options
- **Popup Handling** - Dialog boxes and popups remain floating
- **Entry/Exit Animations** - Visual feedback when adding/removing windows

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable)
- Windows 10/11

### Build Steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thymeline.git
cd thymeline

# Build release version
cargo build --release

# Run
./target/release/thymeline.exe
```

## How It Works

1. **Start Thymeline** - Run the executable
2. **Add Windows** - Focus any window and press `Win+Shift+T` to add it to the grid
3. **Navigate** - Use `Win+Arrow` keys to move through the 2D plane
4. **Organize** - Reposition and resize windows as needed
5. **Exit Cleanly** - Press `Ctrl+C` to restore all windows to their original positions

## Known Limitations

- Only works on Windows 10/11
- Some applications may not respond well to window manipulation
- UWP/Modern apps might have limited functionality
- Multiple monitor setups haven't been tested at all; this was designed for a single monitor
